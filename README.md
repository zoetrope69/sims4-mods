## Enable Mods
Mods are automatically disabled after game updates.
In Sims 4 main menu go to Options -> Game Options -> Other

Apply changes and restart game for changes to take effect.

## Install Mods
Download the file and place it into the Mods folder, within the Sims 4 folder.

* If the file is zipped, unzip first

* Mod file should be placed in Mods, no deeper than a folder
* When updating a mod, make sure to delete previous files to avoid duplicates
